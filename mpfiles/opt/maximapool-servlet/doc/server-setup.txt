When Maxima Pool is installed on a server, the folder layout will probably look
something like this: (only key files shown)

/usr/bin/                     # Installed as part of RHEL.
    gnuplot
    maxima                    # Actually, we use maxima-optimised, but this is present.

/usr/share/tomcat8/webapps/ or /var/lib/tomcat8/webapps/
    MaximaPool.war            # The compiled code. This is what we upload.
    MaximaPool/               # Expanded version of the .war file. Mostly standard.
        META-INF/
            MANIFEST.MF
        WEB-INF/
            web.xml
            classes/
                servlet.conf  # Configuration filewith directory.root & admin.password.
                ...           # All the compiled classes.

/usr/share/tomcat8/logs/      # The Tomcat logs.

/var/lib/maximapool/          # This is the path directory.root from servlet.conf.
    pool.conf                 # Configuration for the whole pool.
    2013073001/               # Directory name is a STACK Maxima code version number.
        process.conf          # Configuration settings for this version.
        maxima-optimised      # The pre-compiled Maxima executable.
        maximalocal.mac       # Extra file loaded on start-up.
        maxima/               # Copy of this version of question/type/stack/stack/maxima.
    2013122500/               # ... can be mulitple versions present simultaniously.
    ...


gnuplot and maxima will have been installed using whatever package manager your
operating system uses.

MaximaPool.war comes from running the Ant build script build.xml after you have
created servlet.conf by editing servlet.example.conf.

pool.conf can be made by copying pool.example.conf and editing.

You can add and remove versions of the Maxima code without stopping the server.
