Maxima Pool test script

1. Set up the file structure with at least two versions of the stack maxima code,
one set to auto-run and the other not.

2. Copy MaximaPool.war to the server, so that the servlet restarts.

3. As the servelet restarts, watch the status page and check that
   a. The auto-run versions start auomatically.
   b. The non-auto-run versions do not start.
   c. The number of processes in each pool rises to an appropriate level.

4. Run the low-level and high-level health-check for the running pool. Verify
they work OK.

5. Run the low-level health-check for the non-running version.

6. Enter the password, and click the button, to start a non-auto-start version.

7. Watch the status page to ensur the number of processes in each pool rises to
an appropriate level.

8. Now stop that version again.

9. Copy a new version of the code into the pool, and re-scan for available versions.

10. Ensure the new version is listed under Non-running versions.

11. Start it.

12. Stop it.

13. Delete that version from disc, re-scan, and ensure it disappears from the list.

14. Copy in a new version, but with the wrong name (not matching the name given
in process.conf.) E.g. a folder called "Copy of 2013060300". Verify that when
you re-scan this folder is ignored.

15. Use the Test form to evaluate something. (Ideally, go to a Moodle site, turn
on CAS debugging, go to the healthcheck page, copy and paste one of the complex
blocks of CAS command, paste that into the test form.)

16. Repeat 14 with a different Pool version if possible. Verify form the output
that the different version was really used.

17. See if you can get it to time-out by using a 1 second Timeout, but you
probably can't test this.
