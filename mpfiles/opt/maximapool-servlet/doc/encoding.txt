Since 2017-10-28 MaximaPool assumes all requests to be UTF-8 encoded and 
marks the response to be UTF-8.

However what is written to the process and received from it still 
depends on the Java environments settings. Basically, should it have 
US-ASCII as "file.encoding" you will never get valid umlauts over your 
runes.

To test your setup simply try inputting this through the test interface:

 s:"äöåé";
 l:slength(s);

The result should render those accents correctly and length as 4. If you 
see "????" you are probably running on some ASCII and will want to fix 
your servlet containers configuration by adding "-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8" 
to JAVA_OPTS or similar.
